# Matrix Implementation
## Summary
This repository has code that implements basic matrix operations. Their sole purpose are to test and demonstrate the two main algorithms of fast matrix multiplication, namely the traditional/naive algorithm and the Strassen algorithm. It will also contain runtime tests.
